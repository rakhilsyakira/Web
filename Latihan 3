<p>I feel like I'm missing something
    I feel like I'm lost in consciousness and dreams
    So sweet in this thick fog
    A dream of walking constantly
    Don't have any clue on the direction. 
</p>
<p>Falling
    Calling
    Chasing
    it's just a dream</p>
<p>This dream that I can't wake up from
    Like a lost night in the dark
    Wandering like I was possessed constantly by you
    No, no, no, I can't stop love
    You keep getting deeper in the darkness
    Deeper in the misty fog that resembles you
    If you ever disappear, I won't let you go.
    It softly tickles me between the gaps in my hands
    That seems to catch and teased me
    Hold you in my arms like you comfort me.
    Just like a air that surrounds you.
    I keep wanting more and more
    A warm dream of you.
    A dream that would stayed and about to vanish
A night seems like about to scatter
The more you try to escape, the clearer you are.
The place that led me by whispering deeper
I'll follow you here forever
Even in the dark 'til the end, it's still you.
</p>
