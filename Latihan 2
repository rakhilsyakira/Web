      You have to chase the things that <u>ignite</u> you. You have to to do the things that bring you joy. You have to surround yourself with the <u>people who bring you back home to yourself,</u> 
      with the people who respect you and embrace you in ways that make you feel like you are worthy and accepted and loved. 
      You have to do the work to heal yourself, even when it hurst - <u>especially when it hurts,</u> so that you do not continue to approach your life 
      within the boundary of what is heavy within you.<span style="background-color: yellow;"> You have to put yourself out there, and cannot worry about what other people think, you cannot rob yourself of experience
        or happiness or inspriration because you are scared of how you will be perceived.</span> You have to be unapologetic
      in the way that you exist here. <span style="background-color: pink;">have to believe that your ideas, and your hope, and your being, deserve to take up space.</span>  
      You have to believe that you have purpose.
